    "__Problem:__ Investors have been investing in various companies in the area based on projected growth in the city. Unfortunately, a number of those ventures have failed because of their locations. As everyone knows, the key to success here is always location, location, location. In order to reduce the chance of failure again, investors are wanting to understand what areas of the city would be the most profitable areas to begin a new business venture based on the current businesses operating profitably in the region and the popularity of the region."
